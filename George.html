    <h3>SCORING</h3>
            <br />
    <p> Offensive players are scored by Touchdowns, Yards, Receptions, and Turnovers.<br /><br />  Kickers get points for both the yardage of the Field Goal and Field Goals made.<br /><br />  Defenders score with Sacks, Tackles, Passes Defended, Turnovers, and Turnover Yards. <br /><br />Quarterbacks are scored on a Tier System. The first TD is worth 2 points and increases by 1 for every TD.  The first 100 yards are .02 per yard and increase by .01 for every 100 yards. This makes it so Quarterbacks outside of the top tier are not overpowered.</p><br />
